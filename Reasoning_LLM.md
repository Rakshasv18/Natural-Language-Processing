## Highlights ## 

# 🤖 Three Types of Reasoning: Deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning are essential frameworks for understanding how language models can process information.
# 📊 Chain of Thought Prompting: This technique helps models articulate their reasoning steps, enhancing their ability to solve complex problems.
# 🔄 Fine-tuning Smaller Models: The Orca model exemplifies how smaller models can be modified to adopt reasoning capabilities from larger counterparts.
# 🧠 Multi-step Reasoning: Techniques like least-to-most prompting are effectively utilized for breaking down complex problems into simpler parts.
# ⚙️ Reinforced Self-Training (REST): Self-training methods show promise for improving reasoning, though they have performance stability concerns.
# 🌐 Generative Decision-Making: A shift towards modeling decision-making as a generative problem offers new pathways for implementing language model agents.
# 📈 Benchmarking Challenges: Current top-performing models face significant challenges, particularly in executing multi-step tasks successfully.
